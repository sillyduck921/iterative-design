                <h4>To understand the process of design (brainstorming, prototyping, critiquing, and user testing), we chose a startup whose mission we resonated with and designed their product. Heyfood is a startup whose product is a food delivery and pickup service for the contintent of Africa (similar to Doordash, UberEats, and Grubhub in the United States). 
                    The company is based in Ibadan, Nigeria, and their target population consists of Millennials and Gen Z urban professionals in 
                    Africa's top 70 cities. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    We sketched four unique versions of Heyfood's product as a mobile app. For each set of sketches, we chose to focus on three separate pages: 
                    Home, Search/Ordering, and Checkout. These pages are core to Heyfood's product and business model, so it was integral to sketch a wide variety of 
                    potential designs.

                <h4>We used the lo-fi prototype to help mock up a preliminary hi-fi prototype of Heyfood's product in Figma. The hi-fi prototype consists of interactive elements, a coordinated color scheme,
                    and a chosen typeface suited for the product and brand. After receiving feedback from our peers and TAs in a studio critique, we made changes to the prototype to
                    address their suggestions and comments. The most notable comments were:

                    the checkout page. We included two action steps and two questions about the page in the following order:

                <h4>
                    Based on the user testing results, we learned about how to improve the usability of our design and the clarity of our instructions. Our startup, Heyfood, mainly focuses on e-commerce and ordering 
                    food, thus the task we set for our users was to complete a transaction (by navigating to the checkout page). 
                    All three users met our expectations and were able to navigate through the app with little difficulty. They found each step of the process easy to understand (choosing a restaurant, 
                    placing an order and checking out) and many of them were able to identify what each symbol and button did. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    We also included a subtask, which asked the users to switch from delivery to pickup. Although all three users were able to complete the main task, they experienced difficulty completing our subtask. 
                    This may be a result of this function only existing on the home page, causing users extra time to figure out how to do this. Some of the users expressed frustration with that fact that you cannot 
                    change the order from delivery to pickup at the checkout page, but need to navigate all the way back to the home page to do this. We plan on adding this functionality due to these concerns.
